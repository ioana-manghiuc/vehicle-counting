  "descriptionYolo11n": "The nano model is the smallest and fastest. Use this if you have limited hardware resources or need real-time processing on mobile or IoT devices.",
  "descriptionYolo11s": "The small model offers a good balance between speed and accuracy. Recommended for laptops with limited GPU memory (2-4GB VRAM).",
  "descriptionYolo11m": "The medium model is the most balanced option. Recommended for laptops with dedicated GPUs (4-6GB VRAM) or desktop computers.",
  "descriptionYolo11l": "The large model offers high accuracy with slower processing. Recommended for high-performance GPUs (8GB+ VRAM) or batch processing.",
  "descriptionYolo11xl": "The extra-large model provides the best accuracy but requires significant computational resources. Recommended for high-end GPUs (12GB+ VRAM) or server environments.",
  "recommendationsTitle": "💡 Recommendations:",
  "recommendation1": "• Start with YOLO11n or YOLO11s if unsure about your hardware capabilities",
  "recommendation2": "• If processing is too slow, downgrade to a smaller model",
  "recommendation3": "• If accuracy is not good enough, upgrade to a larger model",
  "recommendation4": "• GPU acceleration significantly improves speed (CUDA for NVIDIA, Metal for Apple)"
